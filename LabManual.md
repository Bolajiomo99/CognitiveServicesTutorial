# Lab Manual #

## Setting up your Azure account ##

You may activate an Azure free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/.  

If you have been given an Azure Pass to complete this lab, you may go to http://www.microsoftazurepass.com/ to activate it.  Please follow the instructions at https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/howto, which document the activation process.  A Microsoft account may have one free trial on Azure and one Azure Pass associated with it, so if you have already activated an Azure Pass on your Microsoft account, you will need to use the free trial or use another Microsoft account.  

## Navigating the Azure portal ##

After creating an Azure account, you may access the Azure portal at https://portal.azure.com.  

## Navigating the Solution ##

We have created a Solution (.sln) which contains several different projects, let's take a high-level look at them:

- **ImageProcessingLibrary**: This is a Portable Class Library (PCL) containing helper classes for accessing the various Cognitive Services related to Vision, and some "Insights" classes for encapsulating the results.
- **ImageStorageLibrary**: Since DocumentDB does not (yet) support UWP, this is a non-portable library for accessing Blob Storage and DocumentDB.
- **TestApp**: A UWP application that allows you to load your images and call the various cognitive services on them, then explore the results. Useful for experimentation and exploration of your images.
- **TestCLI**: A Console application allowing you to call the various cognitive services and then upload the images and data to Azure. Images are uploaded to Blob Storage, and the various metadata (tags, captions, faces) are uploaded to DocumentDB.

Both _TestApp_ and _TestCLI_ contain a `settings.json` file containing the various keys and endpoints needed for accessing the Cognitive Services and Azure. They start blank, so once you get your Azure Pass up and running we can provision your service keys and set up your storage account and DocumentDB instance.
